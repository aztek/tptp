[TPTP](http://www.tptp.org) (Thousands of Problems for Theorem Provers) is the standard language of problems, proofs, and models, use by automated theorem provers.

This library provides definitions of data types, a pretty printer and an [attoparsec](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/attoparsec) parser for (currently, a subset of) the TPTP language.
