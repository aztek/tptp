[TSTP](http://www.tptp.org/TSTP/) (Thousand Solutions for Theorem Provers) is the standard language of proofs constructed by automated first-order theorem provers.

This library provides definitions of data types, a pretty printer and an [attoparsec](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/attoparsec) parser for (currently, a subset of) the TSTP language.
